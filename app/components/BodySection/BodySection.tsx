        <p>
          I have over 8years of experience in total. For the last 5years I've
          worked as a full-time software developer on Nodejs, React, and Spring
          Boot. I believe in getting the work done in the shortest time possible
          and having my client review it. I advise my client on what to do if no
          plan provided. The aim is to reduce cost and deliver quality product.
